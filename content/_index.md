I'm a [postdoc](https://www.mpibpc.mpg.de/person/42459) at the [Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry](https://www.mpibpc.mpg.de/en), G&ouml;ttingen. I [code](https://github.com/banskt), write [equations](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/04/198911) and solve [problems](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Olrxt2IAAAAJ) which interest and/or annoy me, often learning [new skills](/about) along the way.
