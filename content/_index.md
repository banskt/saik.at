A genuine leader is not a searcher for consensus but a molder of consensus.

I am a computational genomics scientist
in the research group of [David Knowles](https://daklab.github.io/)
at the [New York Genome Center](https://www.nygenome.org/).
I develop machine learning methods for high-dimensional data.
I [code](https://github.com/banskt), write [equations](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/04/198911) 
and solve [problems](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Olrxt2IAAAAJ) which interest and/or annoy me, 
often learning [new skills](/about) along the way.

Before joining the NYGC, I worked with [Matthew Stephens](https://stephenslab.uchicago.edu/) 
in the [Department of Human Genetics](https://genes.uchicago.edu/) at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu).
Earlier, I worked at the [Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences](https://www.mpinat.mpg.de/en), G&ouml;ttingen
with [Johannes S&ouml;ding](https://www.mpibpc.mpg.de/soeding).
I completed my Ph.D in computational biophysics at the [Indian Institute of Science](https://iisc.ac.in/)
in the research group of [Biman Bagchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biman_Bagchi).
