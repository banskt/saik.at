I am a postdoctoral scholar at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu) working with [Matthew Stephens](https://stephenslab.uchicago.edu/).
I [code](https://github.com/banskt), write [equations](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/04/198911) 
and solve [problems](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Olrxt2IAAAAJ) which interest and/or annoy me, often learning [new skills](/about) along the way.

Earlier, I was a postdoctoral scholar at [Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry](https://www.mpibpc.mpg.de/en), G&ouml;ttingen
working with [Johannes S&ouml;ding](https://www.mpibpc.mpg.de/soeding).
