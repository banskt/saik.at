A genuine leader is not a searcher for consensus but a molder of consensus.

I am a postdoctoral scholar at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu) working with [Matthew Stephens](https://stephenslab.uchicago.edu/).
I [code](https://github.com/banskt), write [equations](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/04/198911) 
and solve [problems](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Olrxt2IAAAAJ) which interest and/or annoy me, often learning [new skills](/about) along the way.

Earlier, I worked at the [Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry](https://www.mpibpc.mpg.de/en), G&ouml;ttingen
with [Johannes S&ouml;ding](https://www.mpibpc.mpg.de/soeding). 
I completed my Ph.D at the [Indian Institute of Science](https://iisc.ac.in/) supervised by [Biman Bagchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biman_Bagchi).
