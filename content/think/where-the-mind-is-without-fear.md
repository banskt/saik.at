Home, sweet home in one corner of this [seemingly endless](https://www.worldwidewebsize.com/) virtual world.
This is my own, cosy corner to keep documentation of stuff 
which I think might be useful for me later. 
There's no order or structure to the randomness that you might find here.
If you find anything interesting, feel free to grab.

Let's start with a poem written more than a century ago, but still extremely relevant in modern times. 

> **Where the mind is without fear**<br>
> -- *Rabindranath Tagore*
>
> Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high;<br>
> Where knowledge is free;<br>
> Where the world has not been broken up into fragments;<br>
> By narrow domestic walls;<br>
> Where words come out from the depth of truth;<br>
> Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection;<br>
> Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way;<br>
> Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;<br>
> Where the mind is led forward by thee;<br>
> Into ever-widening thought and action;<br>
> Into that heaven of freedom,<br>
> My Father, let my country awake.
