![This is Git](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png)

I used to look up these shell commands from [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/images/press/git-cheat-sheet.pdf)
or [Github](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf).

However, Git *actually* became easier when 
I read this awesome [guide for the perplexed](http://think-like-a-git.net/),
and skimmed over the [Git Internals PDF](https://github.com/pluralsight/git-internals-pdf) by Scott Chacon.
