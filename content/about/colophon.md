The site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) â€” a static site generator made with Go. 
The website [source code](/) is available on GitHub. 
It uses the [Cocoa](github.com/nishanths/cocoa-hugo-theme) theme,
with minor modifications in CSS and Javascript.
The posts are written in Markdown.

The primary font face is Open Sans and the monospace font face is Ubuntu Mono.
The social icons are from the Ionicons font set. 
CSS classes for code syntax highlighting are inserted during compile-time by Hugo using Pygments.

While looking at websites built with the Cocoa theme, I came across the personal webpage of [Fernando Paolo](http://fspaolo.net/),
and I borrowed several design elements, 
especially the word <span style="text-transform:uppercase; font-family:'Raleway', 'Helvetica Neue', 'Arial', sans-serif; font-weight:bold">Think</span> for my blog.
