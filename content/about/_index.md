I develop statistical methods for analyzing and understanding biomedical data,
with an ultimate goal to understand the regulatory mechanism of complex diseases.

I am passionate about all things data science and biology. I feel excited when I read about machine learning and parallel computing, physics and chemistry.
I discuss history and politics. Here are a dozen fun facts about myself:
<!--- I enjoy being perfect -->
<!--- and I know it can be liberating or exhausting trying to be perfect. -->
<!--- it can break you if you let it or improve you if you embrace it. -->
