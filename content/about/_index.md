I am passionate about machine learning, parallel computing, physics and chemistry, history and politics, and all things data science.
<!--- I enjoy being perfect -->
<!--- and I know it can be liberating or exhausting trying to be perfect. -->
<!--- it can break you if you let it or improve you if you embrace it. -->
To let you know about my personality, skills and hobbies, I compiled a dozen fun facts about myself:
<p class=clear>&nbsp;</p>

1. I write with [fountain pens](https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/).
2. I did my Masters in chemistry, PhD in [statistical mechanics](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1482299860/) (an exciting branch of physics) and postdoctoral research in human genetics.
3. In 2013, I co-founded a marketing management startup called [Beejig](https://web.archive.org/web/20160314203753/http://www.beejig.com/), which became profitable in 8 months. We received a marketing contract from [Lakme India](https://www.lakmeindia.com/), but I abandoned the project because I prefered to pursue my PhD.
4. I love taking [photos](https://500px.com/banskt) but my skills aren’t as good as my taste.
5. I curated [award-winning logos](http://www.logogala.com/gallery/details/thera-brands/), and designed the [branding for a few startups](https://www.behance.net/banskt).
6. Unofficial and biased count shows that I roughly won 95% of all the [Terra Mystica](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/120677/terra-mystica) games played with my friends.
7. I consulted as an Android developer at [Zaxis Labs](https://zaxislabs.com/).
8. I like arthouse, cult, classic, experimental and rare movies from all over the world. My favorite film directors are [Satyajit Ray](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/22/satyajit-ray-artifice-honesty-film), [Ashgar Farhadi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asghar_Farhadi) and [Michael Haneke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Haneke).
<!-- 6. Nice websites fascinate me: I designed and developed a few of them as a freelancer. -->
9. My vacation plans usually involve biking or hiking.
10. Green and maroon are my favorite colors -- they also represent my favorite football team [MohunBagan A.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohun_Bagan_A.C.)
11. In Fantasy Premier League, [my team](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/a/entry/760063/history) achieved a global rank of 1854 in 2014-15.
12. Before I die, I want to see [the Earth from space](https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/a-sky-view-of-earth-from-suomi-npp).

I think I’m a friendly human, so if you ever want to talk to me don’t hesitate to say hello on [twitter](https://twitter.com/banskt), via [email](hellosbanerj) or in person.
