### Research highlights
> **Quasi-Laplace approximation.** 

We found this efficient analytical approximation for Bayesian *multiple logistic* regression with sparse priors,
and used it for analyzing case-control GWAS with binary phenotypes.
Quasi-Laplace approximation outperforms state-of-the-art *linear* models whenever nonlinearities become strong, for example, 
when the numbers of case and control patients differ significantly.
Therefore, novel genetic disease-associated variants could be found by adding controls to existing case-control GWAS 
and reanalyzing them with our software, B-LORE.

> **Diffusion in a rough potential.**

Rugged energy landscapes find wide applications in diverse fields ranging from astrophysics to protein folding.
We found a general expression for the effective diffusion coefficient of a Brownian particle on a random energy surface.
This general expression reduces to the [famous equation of Zwanzig](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.85.7.2029) in the limit of infinite spatial correlation!

> **Orientational order leads to long-range hydrophobicity**

The long range attractive force between two hydrophobic surfaces immersed in water is observed to decrease exponentially with their separation
-- this distance-dependence of effective force is known as the hydrophobic force law. 
Although the phenomenon is conventionally explained by density-dependent theories,
we identified orientation, rather than density, as the relevant order parameter using the 2D Mercedes Benz model of water.
The range of density variation was noticeably shorter than that of orientational heterogeneity.

> **Percolation transition of amphiphilic solutes in aqueous binary mixtures.**

Aqueous binary mixtures of many amphiphilic solutes such as methanol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), ethanol, dioxane, phenol, glycerol, etc.
show dramatic, often exotic, anomalies in thermodynamic and dynamic properties.
In a series of work during my PhD, we found a percolation transition of the solutes,
leading to the formation of a spanning cluster of self-aggregates in the system after a critical percolation concentration. 
Believe it or not, the onset of this percolation occurs at a concentration at which the thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies are found experimentally.
